### About

A cool 3D interactive T-Shirt widget built with with the JavaScript aframe library, using object, textures, dynamic updates!
Built as a proof of concept, this project uses the aframe javascript library to create an interactive room, a collection of `.obj` elements textured dynimcally on the fly. Also using many custom *components* and *animations*!

There is much documentation in both the `.php` files, as well as `main.js`, so feel free to poke around to see how it works!

### Disclaimer

A lot of this code is based on code that written in a hurry and I learned on the fly, so you may find much of the code improvised, WET and maybe not terribly ideal :)

#### OH!

Still not using a lick of jQuery!
